        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Bryan Oliveira, an undergraduate studying Computer Science at
          Caltech.<br>
          This past summer I interned at Navy Federal Credit Union, 
          where I developed a SharePoint site and authored a onboarding guide for 
          new-hires. I spent the prior summer as a Peer Mentor for Caltech's
          First-Year Success Research Institute. I've taken many student leadership/
          government positions during my time at Caltech, and have the honor of
          serving on the Caltech Hispanic and Latino Association's executive 
          committee (Caltech's SHPE and MAES Chapter). I'm also the captain of 
          a Caltech Sunday League Soccer team, and a member of the 
          Caltech Volleyball Club.
